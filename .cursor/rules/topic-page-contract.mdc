# TOPIC PAGE CONTRACT (Content-Heavy + Animations)

Each topic page MUST have exactly two primary tabs:
A) THEORY
B) PRACTICE

## THEORY required sections (must all exist)
1) What you will learn
2) Prerequisites
3) Mental model (simple → deep)
4) Core concepts (break into subsections)
5) Design process (step-by-step)
6) Trade-offs (table)
7) Common mistakes
8) Mini case study (realistic)
9) Interview Q&A (concise answers)
10) 2D Mental Model (ties to practice demo)
11) References (credibility only; not required)

## THEORY Animated Explanation Blocks (required)
Each topic must include 2–6 blocks embedded within theory.
Each block MUST include:
- Title
- Short explanation (2–8 lines)
- Control (stepper/toggle/play) – user-triggered
- "What to notice" bullets (3–6)
- Reduced-motion equivalent (static/instant)
- Link/anchor to the relevant Practice demo part (same page)

Rules:
- No autoplay
- No infinite loops
- Animation must teach (timeline/flow/boundary/trade-off)
- 2D only (SVG/CSS/Framer Motion or GSAP if already installed)
- No 3D, no WebGL, no Three.js

## Empty-state rule
If Theory is missing/empty:
- show explicit “Content missing in CMS” state
- never blank or invisible content
