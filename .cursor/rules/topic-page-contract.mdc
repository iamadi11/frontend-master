# Topic Page Contract

Every topic page MUST render exactly two primary sections/tabs:
A) THEORY (detailed)
B) PRACTICE (interactive)

## THEORY required headings
- What you will learn
- Prerequisites
- Mental model (simple -> deep)
- Core concepts
- Design process (step-by-step)
- Trade-offs (table)
- Common mistakes
- Mini case study
- Interview Q&A
- References (stored in CMS; rendered on-page)

## PRACTICE required structure
- Interactive demo + controls
- Visualization (observable difference)
- Timeline/event log ("what happened" + order)
- Guided steps mode
- Hands-on task + solution reveal + explanation
