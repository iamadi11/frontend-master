# Three.js Dependency Policy

Allowed core deps:
- three
- @react-three/fiber
- @react-three/drei (optional, prefer minimal usage)

Do NOT add:
- postprocessing suites
- physics engines
- large shader libraries
unless explicitly requested and justified by learning value.

If adding a dep:
- explain why it is essential
- confirm it does not bloat the bundle significantly
