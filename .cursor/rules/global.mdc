# Global Rules

## Mission
Build a backend-driven Frontend System Design learning website.
Each topic page MUST have exactly:
1) THEORY (very detailed, structured, reference-backed)
2) PRACTICE (interactive learn-by-doing demos + hands-on tasks + solutions)

Users should not need other sites to learn. References are for credibility, not dependency.

## Non-negotiables
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind. Vercel-friendly.
- Payload CMS + MongoDB. Learning content must be CMS-driven (no hardcoded lessons in route files).
- Correctness-first: do not invent facts. If unsure, label "Needs verification" and store placeholder reference in CMS.
- Server-first: keep client JS minimal; Server Components by default.
- Secrets only via env vars; never expose secrets via NEXT_PUBLIC_.

## Resumable protocol (prevents context overflow)
Implement in SMALL slices only.
Each slice must end with: files changed + DoD checklist + next step.
Do NOT paste large curriculum text into code; store content in CMS (seed minimal placeholders only).
