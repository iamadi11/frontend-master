# GLOBAL (Learning-First, Non-negotiable)

## Mission (do not deviate)
Build a public, backend-driven Frontend System Design learning website that is:
- content-heavy (deep theory; complete coverage)
- self-contained (user does NOT need external links to understand)
- correct and grounded in `frontend_system_design_curriculum.pdf`
- interactive (2D demos for every topic)
- Vercel-friendly (Next.js + Node, Payload CMS, MongoDB; secrets via env only)

## Always-on constraints
- Public learning pages require NO login:
  `/`, `/topics`, `/topics/[slug]`
- Keep changes small to prevent Cursor context overflow:
  one topic OR one focused feature per slice
- Every slice must end with:
  1) files changed
  2) what was verified (build + smoke test steps)
  3) next slice

## Learning quality bar (always)
Theory must be long-form and structured.
Every major theory concept must be reinforced by:
- a theory animation block (2D only) OR
- a practice demo interaction (2D only)
