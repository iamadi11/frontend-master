# Global Constitution (Non-negotiable)

## Mission
Build a backend-driven learning website that becomes the go-to place for learning Frontend System Design.
Every topic MUST have exactly two primary sections:
1) THEORY: very detailed, structured, reference-backed
2) PRACTICE: learn-by-doing, interactive demos + hands-on tasks/solutions

Users should not need to leave this site to learn. References are for credibility—not dependency.

## Core constraints
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind. Vercel-friendly.
- Content is CMS-driven (Payload + MongoDB). Do not hardcode topic lessons in route files.
- Server-first: default to Server Components; keep client JS minimal.
- Secrets only via env vars. Never expose secrets via NEXT_PUBLIC_.
- Correctness-first: do NOT invent facts. If unsure, label "Needs verification" and store a placeholder reference in CMS.
- Heavy animation is REQUIRED, but ONLY as guided/teaching motion (see Motion Policy). Provide reduced-motion mode + UI toggle.

## Scope discipline
Do not add extra features unless explicitly requested.
Focus only on: topic pages, CMS schema, rendering, interactive demos, navigation needed for learning, PWA/offline basics, performance defaults, and deployment hygiene.
