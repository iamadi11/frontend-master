# Animation Slice Protocol (Context-light)

## One topic per slice
- Only implement the requested topic’s 3D mode (or one discrete feature).
- Do not implement other topics in the same pass.

## Hard limits
- Max 12 files changed per slice unless truly necessary.
- No large refactors mixed with animation work.
- Reuse primitives; only add new primitives if at least 2 future topics will reuse them.

## End-of-slice output (required)
- Files changed list
- How to test the demo (route + steps)
- Reduced motion behavior
- Perf notes (DPR, fallback)
- Next step suggestion
