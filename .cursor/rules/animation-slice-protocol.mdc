# ANIMATION SLICE PROTOCOL (Hard)

## One topic per slice
Animation/content implementation must cover ONLY one topic per slice.

## Limits
- Prefer <= 12 file changes per slice
- Avoid big refactors in animation slices

## End-of-slice output (required)
- files changed list
- how to test (route + exact steps)
- reduced motion summary
- WebGL fallback behavior (if 3D)
- next slice suggestion
