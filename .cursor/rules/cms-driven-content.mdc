# CMS-driven Content Rule

- All Theory and Practice content must come from Payload CMS (MongoDB).
- Keep Next routes thin: fetch data via a server-only lib layer and render via shared components.
- Always handle empty CMS state gracefully (empty lists, not-found, friendly admin hint).
- Never leak secrets to the client; only use NEXT_PUBLIC_ for safe values like site URL.
- Use server-only guards where appropriate.
