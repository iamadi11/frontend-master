# CMS-driven Content

- All Theory + Practice + References live in Payload CMS (MongoDB).
- Next routes must be thin: fetch via server-only lib layer and render via shared components.
- Handle empty CMS state gracefully (no crashes).
- Never leak secrets to client; NEXT_PUBLIC_ only for safe values (e.g., site URL).
