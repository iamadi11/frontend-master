# Focus-only Motion Policy

## Allowed
- Route transitions: opacity + small translateY (150–250ms)
- Subtle highlight of changed area after user interaction
- Progressive disclosure (accordion) for explanations

## Not allowed
- Looping animations, parallax, confetti, bouncing, flashy 3D
- Anything that competes with reading or comprehension

## Accessibility
- If prefers-reduced-motion: disable motion; use static emphasis (outline/background)
- Keep client components minimal and only where necessary
