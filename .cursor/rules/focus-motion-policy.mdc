# Motion Policy (Heavy, but Focus-Guiding Only)

## Requirement
The website MUST use heavy animation, but animation must function as:
- a teaching aid (visualize system behavior)
- a focus tool (guide attention to the current concept/section)
- a state-change explanation (before/after, transitions, timelines)

Animation must NEVER be purely decorative.

## Allowed heavy motion (examples)
- Guided transitions between sections/steps (storytelling mode)
- Animated timelines (rendering phases, caching hits/misses, hydration stages)
- Animated diffs (SSR vs CSR output changes)
- Spotlight/highlight animations that direct attention to the active panel
- Progress/stepper animations for interactive exercises
- Smooth layout transitions for expanding explanations (motion for comprehension)
- Animated “flow diagrams” that respond to user input (not auto-looping)

## Forbidden motion
- Infinite looping animations without user action
- Parallax/background motion that competes with reading
- Attention-grabbing effects not tied to learning (confetti, random bounces, flashy decorative 3D)

## Implementation rules
- Animations must be triggered by meaningful events (user interaction, step change, state transition).
- Use consistent motion timing:
  - micro: 120–200ms
  - instructional transitions: 250–450ms
- Prefer layout + opacity + transform animations; keep them smooth and readable.
- Maintain 60fps: avoid heavy re-renders; memoize; isolate animated layers; use requestAnimationFrame for canvas-like visuals.
- Centralize animation primitives (one motion system) so behavior is consistent.

## Accessibility
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion AND provide an in-UI toggle "Reduce motion" (persisted).
- Reduced-motion mode must disable non-essential motion and swap to:
  - instant transitions + static emphasis (outline/background)
  - non-animated timelines (static step highlight)

## Practice demos
Every PRACTICE demo MUST use animations where they help users understand the concept
(timelines, transitions, state visuals). No decorative-only motion.
