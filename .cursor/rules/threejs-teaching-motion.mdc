# THREE.JS TEACHING MOTION (Strict)

## Purpose
3D exists only to teach a concept more clearly than 2D.

## Rules (hard)
- No idle loops; animations only on user trigger or step change
- Must respect Reduce Motion:
  - no camera travel/pulses/lerps in reduced motion
  - use static emphasis instead
- Must have WebGL failure fallback to 2D automatically
- Cap DPR on mobile; keep geometry minimal

## Alignment rule (hard)
3D visuals must match:
- PDF scope for that topic
- CMS config outputs
- Event Log causal narration
- Theory 2D/3D Mental Model explanation
