# PDF REFERENCE POLICY (Curriculum Truth Source)

## Source of truth
`frontend_system_design_curriculum.pdf` defines:
- the 12 topics and their order
- the boundaries of each topic (what belongs / doesn’t belong)
- the expected learning outcomes and core subtopics

## Mandatory workflow for ANY content/animation/demo work
1) Verify the topic boundary from the PDF (or local text extract if present).
2) Implement theory + animations + demos to match that boundary.
3) Paraphrase and improve explanations; do NOT copy text.

## No-copy rule
- Do NOT paste large PDF text into:
  - repo files (code/docs)
  - CMS seed scripts
  - CMS entries
- If quoting is unavoidable, keep it <= 1–2 lines.

## Coverage rule
For each topic, coverage must match the PDF scope:
- no missing subtopics
- no extra subtopics outside scope
If a PDF item can’t be located/confirmed, label “Needs verification”.
