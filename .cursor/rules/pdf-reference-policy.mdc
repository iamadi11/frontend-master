# PDF Reference Policy (Accuracy without Context Bloat)

## Source of truth
If present, treat these as authoritative:
- docs/_source/frontend-system-design-curriculum.pdf
- docs/_source/curriculum.txt

## How to use
- Consult PDF/extract to verify definitions, trade-offs, case studies, practice demo requirements.
- Summarize into CMS fields in your own words.

## Hard limits
- Do NOT paste long PDF text into code, prompts, or repo files.
- Do NOT generate entire curriculum in one go.
- Extract the minimum needed for the current topic slice only.

## If unclear
Mark "Needs verification" in CMS and add placeholder reference.
