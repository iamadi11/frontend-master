# Content Correctness Policy

## No hallucinations
- Do not invent browser behaviors, standards, metrics, or tool capabilities.
- If uncertain: label “Needs verification”, and add a placeholder reference entry in CMS.

## Claim-to-reference mapping
- Any non-trivial claim must be supported by at least one Reference stored in CMS.
- References must be rendered on the topic page (Theory section).
- Prefer primary sources: specs, official docs, reputable engineering posts.

## On-site learning completeness
- Do not require users to read external sites to understand the concept.
- External references are supplementary; the explanation must stand alone.
