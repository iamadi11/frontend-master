# CONTENT CORRECTNESS (Strict, Content-Heavy)

## No hallucinations
Do not invent:
- browser/React/Next behavior
- security guarantees
- performance metric meaning
If unsure:
- label “Needs verification”
- keep statements conservative

## Self-contained learning (hard requirement)
Users must not need external links to understand:
- every core concept must be fully explained on-page
- references are credibility only (optional reading)

## Content must be explainable by animations/demos
If a theory claim is made, ensure one of these exists:
- a Theory Animated Explanation Block that illustrates it, OR
- a Practice demo interaction that demonstrates it

## Consistent vocabulary (mandatory)
Use the same terms everywhere:
Theory / Practice / Guided Steps / Tasks / Solution / Event Log / Animated Explanation / 2D / 3D
