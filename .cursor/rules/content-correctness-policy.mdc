# Content Correctness Policy

- Do not invent browser behaviors, standards, metrics, tool capabilities, or security properties.
- If uncertain: label "Needs verification" and store placeholder reference in CMS.
- Non-trivial claims must have references stored in CMS and rendered on the topic page.
- Users should be able to learn without leaving the site (references are supplementary).
