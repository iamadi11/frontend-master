# LEARNING DEMO PM SPEC (Required)

Before implementing a NEW demo OR a new theory animation block set, define:
- Problem (what learner struggles with)
- Outcome (what learner can do after)
- Interaction model (controls → visual change)
- Animation plan (what animates and why)
- Reduced motion behavior
- Success criteria (how we know it teaches)
- Risks (perf, distraction, correctness)

Implementation must match the spec.
