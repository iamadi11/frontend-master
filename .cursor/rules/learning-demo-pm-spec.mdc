# Learning Demo PM Spec Rule

Before implementing a new demo (2D or 3D), include a short spec in the PR/slice output (not in code comments):
- Problem: what learners struggle with
- User outcome: what they can do after the demo
- Interaction model: controls + what user sees changing
- Animation plan: list of purposeful animations (no decoration)
- Reduced motion behavior
- Success criteria: measurable outcomes (completion, task correctness)
- Risks: performance, confusion, accessibility

The implementation must match the spec.
