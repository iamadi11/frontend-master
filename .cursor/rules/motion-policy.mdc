# MOTION POLICY (Learning-first, Not Decorative)

## Heavy motion requirement
Use motion strongly where it improves understanding, but only for teaching:
- timelines (request → render → hydrate)
- flows (data/cache/auth)
- boundaries (modules/edge/CDN)
- trade-offs (before/after)

## Forbidden
- autoplay while reading
- background loops
- motion that competes with content readability

## Trigger rule
Animations only run on user actions:
- play / next step / toggle / hover micro-interaction

## Reduced motion (mandatory)
Reduced motion must remain equally understandable:
- replace movement with static emphasis, outlines, instant transitions
