# Motion Policy (Heavy, Teaching-Only)

## Requirement
Use heavy animation across the site and demos ONLY to:
- teach (visualize system behavior)
- guide focus (spotlight current panel/step)
- explain state changes (timelines/diffs/transitions)

No decorative motion.

## Must-have
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- Provide an in-UI "Reduce motion" toggle (persisted)
- Reduced motion must remain fully usable (static emphasis instead of motion)

## Allowed teaching animations
- Animated timelines (CSR/SSR/hydration/caching phases)
- Animated diffs (before/after output, cache hit/miss)
- Spotlight/highlight tied to user actions
- Stepper/story transitions in Practice
- 3D (Three.js / R3F) animations ONLY if they clarify system behavior; must be user-triggered and reduced-motion safe

## Forbidden
- Auto-looping animations without user action
- Parallax/background motion competing with reading
- Flashy effects not tied to learning
