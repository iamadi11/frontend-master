# Scope Guardrails (Hard boundaries)

## Do NOT add (unless user explicitly requests)
- Learner accounts/login, comments, likes, ratings, payments, subscriptions
- Gamification: points, badges, leaderboards, streaks
- Notifications, emails, community features
- Complex search engine, recommendations, personalization
- Unnecessary microservices / over-architecture
- Random UI experiments unrelated to learning

## Do add (only what supports the mission)
- CMS-driven topic content + references
- Two-section topic pages (Theory + Practice)
- Minimal information architecture: topics list, next/prev, tags only as needed for learning flow
- Heavy but focus-guiding motion (teaching animations)
- PWA/offline plumbing and basic caching
- Vercel + MongoDB env correctness
