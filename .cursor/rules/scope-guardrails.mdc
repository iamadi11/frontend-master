# Scope Guardrails

Do NOT add unless explicitly requested:
- Learner accounts/login, comments, likes/ratings
- Payments/subscriptions
- Gamification (points/badges/leaderboards/streaks)
- Notifications/community features
- Complex search/recommendations/personalization
- Over-architecture

Only build what supports learning:
- Topic pages (Theory + Practice)
- CMS schema + rendering + interactive demos
- Minimal navigation for learning flow
- PWA/offline plumbing + performance basics
- Vercel + MongoDB deployment hygiene
