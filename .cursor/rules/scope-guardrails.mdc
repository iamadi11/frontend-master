# Scope Guardrails (Hard boundaries)

## Do NOT add unless explicitly requested
- Learner accounts/login, comments, likes/ratings
- Payments/subscriptions
- Gamification (points/badges/leaderboards/streaks)
- Notifications/community/community feeds
- Complex search/recommendations/personalization
- Over-architecture/microservices

## Only build what supports learning
- Topic pages (Theory + Practice)
- CMS schema + rendering + interactive demos
- Minimal navigation needed for learning flow
- PWA/offline basics + performance fundamentals
- Deployment hygiene for Vercel + MongoDB
