# Practice Demo Contract

- Practice demo behavior must be CMS-driven (demoConfig JSON + steps + tasks + references).
- Validate demoConfig with Zod at runtime.
- If invalid/missing: show friendly fallback (no crash).

Minimum demo UX:
- Controls (tabs/toggles/sliders)
- Visualization panel
- Timeline/event log
- Guided steps (Step 1..N)
- Task + solution reveal + explanation

Teaching motion:
- Use heavy motion to visualize transitions/timelines/diffs.
- Provide reduced-motion static alternative.
