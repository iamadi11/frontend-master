# Practice Demo Contract (Non-negotiable for Practice)

## CMS-driven only
- Practice demos must be driven from CMS fields (demoConfig + steps + tasks).
- Do not hardcode topic logic in Next routes. Routes fetch + render only.

## Required demo UX (minimum)
- Controls: toggles/tabs/sliders that change behavior
- Visualization: shows observable difference (before/after or side-by-side)
- Timeline/event log: explains what changed when controls are used
- Guided steps mode: Step 1..N with highlight of relevant UI area
- Hands-on task: user must predict/choose/adjust; then reveal solution + explanation

## Demo config validation
- Define a JSON schema for demoConfig and validate with Zod at runtime.
- If config invalid/missing: show a friendly “Demo unavailable” state (no crash).

## Teaching animations (heavy but purposeful)
- Practice demos must use motion to illustrate change (timelines, flows, diffs).
- Do not add decorative motion that doesn’t explain something.
- Respect reduced-motion mode and provide a usable static alternative.
