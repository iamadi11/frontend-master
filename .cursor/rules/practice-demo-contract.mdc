# PRACTICE DEMO CONTRACT (Learn-by-Doing)

## CMS-driven (mandatory)
Practice demo behavior/content must come from CMS config.
Hardcoding lesson text in route files is forbidden.

## Validation (mandatory)
- Validate config using Zod
- If invalid/missing: show friendly fallback, never crash

## Must include (all)
- Controls
- Visualization
- Event Log (explains what happened and why)
- Guided Steps
- Tasks + Solution Reveal + Explanation

## 2D only (mandatory)
Every topic must have a working 2D demo.
- Use SVG/CSS/Framer Motion or GSAP if already installed
- No 3D, no WebGL, no Three.js
- Simple yet classy animations that teach without distracting
