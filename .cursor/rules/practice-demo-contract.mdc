# Practice Demo Contract

## CMS-driven only
- Practice demo behavior must come from CMS fields (demoConfig JSON + steps + tasks + references).
- No hardcoded topic logic inside route files.

## Minimum demo UX
- Controls (tabs/toggles/sliders)
- Visualization panel
- Timeline/event log
- Guided steps (Step 1..N)
- Task + solution reveal + explanation

## Validation + fallback
- Validate demoConfig with Zod at runtime.
- If invalid/missing: show friendly fallback ("Demo unavailable") and do not crash.

## Teaching motion
- Use heavy motion to visualize transitions/timelines/diffs.
- Provide reduced-motion static alternative.
